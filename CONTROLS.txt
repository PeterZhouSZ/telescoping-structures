WASD moves the camera
Right-click-drag changes the view direction

Mesh skeletonization:

Shift-G performs one iteration of volume-minimizing flow
Shift-H performs quadric edge collapse to recover a 1D line structure.

Spline phase:

Shift-N adds a new spline
Shift-B adds a new bulb

Right-clicking on a spline control point inserts a new control point before it
Scroll wheel on top of bulbs resizes them
Left click drags around all elements.
Drag a spline endpoint into a bulb to attach the spline to the bulb at that endpoint.

Shift-P finalizes the spline and converts it to a discrete curve.

Discrete curve phase:

Shift-L toggles curvature flow on/off
Shift-K toggles torsion flow on/off
Ctrl-Shift-L replaces all curvature with the average value
Ctrl-Shift-K replaces all torsion with the average value

Shift-O attempts to approximate the current curve by a piecewise constant impulse curve, using a QP
Ctrl-Shift-O attempts to do the same thing by solving a linear system instead

After making an approximation, Enter confirms and finalizes the approximate curve.

Impulse curve phase:

Shift-I creates a telescope.

Telescope phase:

Q retracts the telescope, E extends it.
] (right bracket) performs one iteration of constraint projection on telescope attachment points.
